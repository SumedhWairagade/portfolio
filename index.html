                    </ul>
                    <h4>ML/AI Intern - ExpertsHub, India</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this internship, I was introduced to the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms, like, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, K-means Clustering, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Algorithm, Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, etc.</li>
                        <li>My team won the best intern prize, as we completed all the tasks and successfully build a program to identify the sentiments of the given tweets. Where we used Support Vector Machine to process the words separately, where all the labels were known, to train the model.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Internshala Student Partner - Internshala, India</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This internship was to involve the students in the on-campus activities carried out by the internshala. It was to promote the Internshala courses to the students who could use these courses to enhance their resumes. I learned how to work in a group and how to coordinate with other student partners to organise the events for students.</li>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h4>Family Asset Management</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build an application for an individual's heritage management. Where we also Displayed the current market value of their estate. Also tracked the ongoing operations on each.</li>
                    <li>We implemented this project using ReactJs, for Software Engineering course in my graduate program. It was great experience to learn ReactJs. It allowed us to work independently to develop the application, we divided the components amonst us and successfully developed the application.</li>
                    <li>This Project was to understand and implement the management skills on the given group project, taught during the course.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Object Classification</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>We implemented the Transfer learning concept in this project where we used the pretrained model and transfered the weights of the model. We used a model that was trained on a very big dataset known as VGG-19.</li>
                    <li>It was a group project for the Machine Learning course to understand the working of the Transfer Learning given the dataset of different classes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Speech Sentiment Analysis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a web-application for this project where we took audio input from the user and fed it to the model to get the output.</li>
                    <li>We used Natural Language Processing and Support Vector Machines to convert the given audio file into text and then perform analysis on it and obtain the sentiment of the given input.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Generation and Optimization of time-table using Genetic Algorithm</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modeled productive Artificial Intelligence application for optimizatoin and generation of course time-table.</li>
                    <li>In this project we coordinated with the an established college at the university to gather the requirements for creating schedule for all the courses. We used Java-servlet framework for building the UI and used multiple Algorithms to find the best one for this application, Genetic Algorithm. Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Heuristic Approach were not much efficient to find optimal solution for this time-table scheduling problem.</li>
                    <li>This was an Undergraduate final semester project where we had implement all the technologies learned during the four years of Undergraduate program. We also published a <a href="http://ecc.journalspub.info/index.php?journal=JESET&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=1438" target="_blank">paper</a> on this project</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This was a project which was implemented in an internship, where we developed a model using predefined libraries and APIs for data, which mapped the keywords from the tweets to the defined sentiments.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Property Management</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>This project required us to learn the Database Management and server handling techniques using XAMPP. To manage data we used MySQL and used Java and Java Server pages for the UI and the database connectivity.</li>
                    <li>It was a group learning project where we understood and implemented the levels of Normal Forms in the Database</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Maharashtra Tourism</h4>
                <ul>
